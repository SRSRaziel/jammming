# Jammming

This project was created for a React lesson on Codecademy.

## Description

Jammming allows you to search for any track available on Spotify. With this, you can create a Playlist and then upload it to your Spotify account.

## Features

Jamming uses the Spotify API to search for tracks. I also created buttons to add and remove tracks from the playlist and at the end, a button that sends this playlist to your Spotify.
